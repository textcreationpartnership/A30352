11. Question. Whether a Bishop hath Authority to make a
Priest by the Scripture, or no? And whether any other but only a Bishop may

Preach and Teach the Word of God there, or no? And also make and constitute
Priests, or no?

14. Question. Whether it be forefended by God's Law, that
(if it so fortune that all the Bishops and Priests of a Region were dead, and

Baptism, and others unministred) that the King of that Region should
make Bishops and Priests to supply the same, or no?
